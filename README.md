# BPSI2
Quest pre release software installed right

You can get the installer at: https://github.com/TristanCanDev/BPSI2/releases/tag/v1.0.0
After you go through the installer, you can: Set your pavlov name, install pavlov, and push custom pavlov maps to your quest.

PLEASE NOTE: BPSI WILL TAKE AROUND A MINUTE TO START FOR THE FIRST TIME DUE TO THE ADB INSTALLATION. PLEASE DO NOT TERMINATE THE PROGRAM

If you encounter any bugs, feel free to reach out and report them to me on my discord blu#0666.
